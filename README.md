#  Loan Approval Prediction
                                                                                  
Loan Prediction ia a very common in real-life problem that each retail bank faces atleast once in its lifetime. I done Correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.
## Objectives:
It is a classification Problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not.

## Implementation:

- Imported all necessary libraries utilized in the project.
- Loaded the dataset.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Performed preprocessing tasks, such as handling null values and removing unnecessary attributes.
- Separated the features and target attributes, followed by splitting the dataset into a 70-30 ratio for training and testing.
- Applied the following machine learning models:
  - Extreme Gradient Boosting Mode
  - Logistic Regressor Mode
  - K-nearest neighbor Model
  - Naive Bayes Model
  - RandomForest Model

## Results of All models:
- Model Evaluation Metrics
